ProblemSet

1)Hangman
  
  In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer. 

2)A word game 
  
  This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.

3)Encryption
  
  A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The original information is called plaintext. After it is encrypted, it is called ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but it is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish to those for whom it is not intended.

4)News feed monitor

## CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science

This is perphaps the most exciting course which I have ever taken since the university even though it is only an online introdution course. What really impressed me is the passion that David(Lecturer of CS50) passed through 
the intensice lectures where I learned C, python and flask, html, CSS and javascript. After scratching my head into the problem sets, I feel more confident to actually program on my own. Unlike the teaching style which I used to have - robotic repeating 
books, I finally felt the pleasure of catching up with the lecturer. Throughout finishing all the problem sets given, the words 
in the first course - **CS is a tool we can use to do more powerful and interesting things in any other field.**  make more senses 
to me.

### Problem sets summary
* Pset3 - resize that resizes (i.e., enlarges or shrinks) 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of f with C.
* Pset4 - implement a program that spell-checks a file.
* Pset8 - toy website to quote, buy and sell the stock.
