ProblemSet

1)Hangman
  
  In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer. 

2)A word game 
  
  This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.

3)Encryption
  
  A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The original information is called plaintext. After it is encrypted, it is called ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but it is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish to those for whom it is not intended.

4) News feed monitor

Amazing MIT opencourse!
